Q.3 What method do you call in an SQLIte cursor object in Python to run an SQL command?

    what is the purpose of the "?"?
    
A.4 It is a placeholder for the contents of the "org" variable

Q.5 In the following Python code sequence (assuming cur is a SQLite cursor object),

    what is the value in row if no rows match the WHERE clause?
    
A.5 None

Q.6 What does the LIMIT clause in the following SQL accomplish?

    ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10
