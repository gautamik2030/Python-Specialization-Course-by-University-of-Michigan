# Python-Specialization-Course-by-University-of-Michigan
There are 5 courses in the University of Michigan Python specialization course, introducing learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

I am providing you the answers to the quizzes and assignments to all the five courses here to help you whenever you get stuck. But remember all the answers are in the videos, do watch them carefully and practice as much as you can. 

All the best!
